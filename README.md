# rock-paper-scissors

My take on the rock-paper-scissors game while using JavaScript. It was a fun project to build, amd my first project with an interactive UI that was made with JavaScript.

What I learned:
- DOM and DOM manipulation with plain JavaScript.
  - How to add and change elements.
  - How to handle events.
- Data-attributes and what they are for.
- Breaking problems into smaller chunks instead of thinking about all the problems at the same time.
